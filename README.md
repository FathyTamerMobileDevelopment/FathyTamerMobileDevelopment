## 👋 Hi, I’m [Your Name]

I’m a **Mobile Developer** who loves building delightful, performant mobile apps and a **UI/UX Designer** who crafts intuitive, human-centered interfaces. I bridge the gap between design and code — turning pixel-perfect mockups into responsive, accessible apps.

**Location:** Cairo, Egypt • **Role:** Mobile Developer & UI/UX Designer

---

## 🚀 Highlights

* ✨ Pixel-perfect UI implementations in **Flutter** and **React Native**
* 🎨 End-to-end product design: research, wireframes, UX flows, high-fidelity UI, and prototypes
* ⚡ Performance optimization, CI/CD setups, and app store publishing experience
* 🧪 Usability testing & accessibility-first mindset

</p>

* **Process:** Research → Wireframes → Prototyping → Visual Design → Handoff
* **Deliverables:** User flows, clickable prototypes, redlines, component library (Figma)
* **Micro-interactions:** Lottie animations for delight and clarity

---

## 📐 UI/UX Principles I Follow

* **Clarity first:** every screen answers "what can I do next?"
* **Consistency:** shared components and tokens
* **Accessibility:** contrast, hit target sizes, semantic structures
* **Performance-aware design:** minimal layers, optimized illustrations

---

## 🧩 Component Library & Tokens

I maintain a design system (Figma + code) that includes:

* Color tokens (light/dark)
* Typography scale (Almarai for Arabic-heavy projects)
* Spacing system and grid
* Reusable components: Button, Input, Card, Modal, Bottom Sheet

---

## 📸 Screenshots & GIFs (How to add)

* Add images/GIFs inside your repo under `/assets` or `/docs`.
* Reference them in README like this:

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/your-demo.gif" alt="demo" width="700" />
</p>
```

* For external GIFs (hosted on Giphy or raw GitHub URLs), use the full URL. Local images are preferable for reliability.

---

## 🧾 Badges & Icons

You can add live badges from **shields.io** to show skills, tools, or status:

```markdown
![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?logo=flutter&logoColor=white)
![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-F24E1E?logo=figma&logoColor=white)
![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-00B4AB?logo=dart&logoColor=white)
```

Use emoji inline for quick visual cues:

```markdown
- 🎯 Focus: Mobile UX & Performance
- 🧠 Role: Product-minded engineer
```

---

## ✨ Styling tips for README (GitHub-friendly)

* Keep images hosted in the repo so they render reliably.
* Use small GIF sizes (compress) to keep the README lightweight.
* Prefer simple HTML for centering (`<p align="center">`), since GitHub supports it.
* You can create a `docs/` folder and enable GitHub Pages for a polished portfolio site.
